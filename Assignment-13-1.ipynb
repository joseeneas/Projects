The Gurobi Optimizer is widely used for solving mathematical optimization problems, such as linear programming and mixed-integer programming. The alias `gp` simplifies the usage of the library in the code, allowing you to refer to it more succinctly.\n",

Importing it directly allows you to use these constants without needing to prefix them with `gp.`.\n",

This is often used when the imported libraries are not fully compatible with the type-checking tool or when type hints are not available for the library. It ensures that type-checking does not raise unnecessary warnings or errors, allowing the code to pass validation smoothly.\n",

    "In summary, this snippet sets up the necessary imports for working with data (`pandas`) and optimization models (`gurobipy`) while ensuring that type-checking tools do not interfere with the imports. The use of aliases (`pd` and `gp`) and direct imports (`GRB`) improves code readability and convenience."

These constraints include supply limits, demand satisfaction, depot throughput, and flow conservation, ensuring the solution is feasible within the problem's parameters.\n",
